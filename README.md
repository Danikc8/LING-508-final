# LING-508-final

In this project, a user can enter in a Chinese character and the 
app will return Cantonese linguistic information for that character. 
This app is only working wih a small subset of Cantonese characters 
from the Hong Kong Cantonese Corpus (HKCanCor). If you enter in 
a character, letter, or string that does not exist in the corpus 
subset, you will not get a result.

*Note:*  
The app is only returning the most common usage and part of speech 
for the character. In reality, most characters have many meanings 
and part of speech tags, depending on their usage.

### Example

Input: "心"

Output:

| **Form** | **Part of Speech** | **Jyutping Romanization** | **Phonological Components** | **English Translation** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 心 | NOUN | sam1 | onset: s, nnucleus: a, coda: m, tone: 1 | Heart |
